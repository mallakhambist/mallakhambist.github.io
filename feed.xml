<h3><strong>What is Mallakhamb?</strong></h3>
<p class="p3"> </p>
<p class="p4">Mallakhamb is an ancient Indian sport that blends strength, agility, flexibility, and focus. Performed on a vertical wooden pole or hanging rope, it involves acrobatic poses, yoga postures, and gymnastic transitions—all executed with grace and control.</p>
<p class="p3"> </p>
<p class="p4">Derived from the words <i>“Malla”</i> (wrestler) and <i>“Khamb”</i> (pole), this discipline was historically used to train wrestlers in body coordination and mental discipline.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>A Sport Rooted in Tradition</strong></h3>
<p class="p3"> </p>
<p class="p4">Though its origins date back to the 12th century (and perhaps earlier), Mallakhamb continues to evolve. Today, it is recognized as a competitive sport with structured formats like <span class="s2"><strong>Pole Mallakhamb</strong></span>, <span class="s2"><strong>Rope Mallakhamb</strong></span>, and <span class="s2"><strong>Hanging Mallakhamb</strong></span>.</p>
<p class="p3"> </p>
<p class="p4">Yet, at its heart, it remains a cultural treasure—an art form that carries the soul of Indian physical training.</p>
