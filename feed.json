In reality? Most athletes only found out <em data-start=\"867\" data-end=\"878\">last week</em>.</p>\n<p data-start=\"883\" data-end=\"1185\">Yes, you read that right. A tournament announced three months ago was a secret for many until just a few days back. Meanwhile, some universities had already held trials, formed squads, and even started training camps weeks ago. Others? Still scrambling to decide <em data-start=\"1146\" data-end=\"1152\">when</em> to hold selections, if at all.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://mallakhambist.in/media/posts/12/Screenshot-2025-09-02-at-10.28.57-PM.png\" alt=\"AIU Sports Calendar for Indigenous Sports\" width=\"879\" height=\"750\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://mallakhambist.in/media/posts/12/responsive/Screenshot-2025-09-02-at-10.28.57-PM-xs.png 300w ,https://mallakhambist.in/media/posts/12/responsive/Screenshot-2025-09-02-at-10.28.57-PM-sm.png 480w ,https://mallakhambist.in/media/posts/12/responsive/Screenshot-2025-09-02-at-10.28.57-PM-md.png 768w ,https://mallakhambist.in/media/posts/12/responsive/Screenshot-2025-09-02-at-10.28.57-PM-lg.png 1024w ,https://mallakhambist.in/media/posts/12/responsive/Screenshot-2025-09-02-at-10.28.57-PM-xl.png 1360w ,https://mallakhambist.in/media/posts/12/responsive/Screenshot-2025-09-02-at-10.28.57-PM-2xl.png 1600w\"><figcaption>AIU's Sports Calendar 2025-26 for Indigenous Sports.</figcaption></figure>\n<p data-start=\"1187\" data-end=\"1215\"> </p>\n<p data-start=\"1187\" data-end=\"1215\">So, the obvious questions:</p>\n<ul data-start=\"1217\" data-end=\"1509\">\n<li data-start=\"1217\" data-end=\"1302\">\n<p data-start=\"1219\" data-end=\"1302\"><strong data-start=\"1219\" data-end=\"1300\">Why wasn’t the calendar made public for athletes the minute it was published?</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li data-start=\"1303\" data-end=\"1407\">\n<p data-start=\"1305\" data-end=\"1407\"><strong data-start=\"1305\" data-end=\"1405\">How did some universities know so early, while others stayed clueless? Insider advantage, maybe?</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li data-start=\"1408\" data-end=\"1509\">\n<p data-start=\"1410\" data-end=\"1509\"><strong data-start=\"1410\" data-end=\"1507\">And why are athletes—the very people these tournaments are meant for—always the last to know?</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 data-start=\"1511\" data-end=\"1531\">Unequal Starts</h1>\n<p data-start=\"1532\" data-end=\"1871\">For sports like Mallakhamb, preparation isn’t just about turning up with a team. It takes months of conditioning, refining techniques, and getting used to specialized apparatus. When some athletes get weeks of structured training camps and others barely get time to recover from their selection trials, how is this a level playing field?</p>\n<p data-start=\"1873\" data-end=\"2147\">Imagine being a student who hears about the competition only a couple of weeks before entries close. You juggle academics, exams, maybe even part-time work—and now you’re expected to be competition-ready against athletes who’ve had head start prep time. Fair? Not even close.</p>\n<h1 data-start=\"2149\" data-end=\"2173\">The Larger Problem</h1>\n<p data-start=\"2174\" data-end=\"2440\">This isn’t a one-off hiccup. It’s a pattern. Every year, the calendar gets finalized in neat PDFs and official circulars. But somewhere between the AIU’s announcement and the athletes who actually step onto the field, the message gets lost—or deliberately delayed.</p>\n<p data-start=\"2442\" data-end=\"2737\">Why? Bureaucratic lag? Universities not bothering to circulate the information? Or is it that some universities, with better connections, always seem to get the memo early? Whatever the reason, the outcome is the same: <strong data-start=\"2661\" data-end=\"2735\">the system rewards a few, while leaving the majority to play catch-up.</strong></p>\n<h1 data-start=\"2739\" data-end=\"2760\">Fixing the Game</h1>\n<p data-start=\"2761\" data-end=\"3020\">It doesn’t have to be this way. Imagine if, the moment the GR is released, the schedule is posted on an official, athlete-facing platform—social media, a central website, even WhatsApp groups run by federations. No middlemen, no selective leaks, no excuses.</p>\n<p data-start=\"3022\" data-end=\"3251\">And why not make trial deadlines uniform across universities? That way, no team has a head start, and every athlete gets a fair chance. After all, the goal of university sport isn’t just to host events—it’s to <em data-start=\"3232\" data-end=\"3248\">develop talent</em>.</p>\n<h1 data-start=\"3253\" data-end=\"3272\">Final Whistle</h1>\n<p data-start=\"3273\" data-end=\"3554\">The Mallakhamb events of 2025 are a reminder of how broken the communication system in university sports really is. Athletes shouldn’t have to rely on whispers, late emails, or sheer luck to know when their big tournaments are happening. They deserve clarity, time, and fairness.</p>\n<p data-start=\"3556\" data-end=\"3735\">Until that happens, the Association of Indian Universities Games will remain less about sporting excellence and more about who knew what, when. And that’s not a game anyone signed up to play.</p>",

From spices that changed global trade routes, to yoga that heals millions, to cinema and cricket that capture imaginations—its gifts to the world are endless.</p>\n<p data-start=\"652\" data-end=\"836\">But hidden among these treasures lies something extraordinary. A sport both fierce and graceful. A sport where the human body becomes poetry in motion. A sport called <strong data-start=\"819\" data-end=\"833\">Mallakhamb</strong>.</p>\n<p data-start=\"838\" data-end=\"1094\">If you’ve ever seen an athlete spin around a pole, hanging upside down with impossible balance, or glide through the air on a rope as if gravity didn’t exist—you’ve witnessed Mallakhamb. It’s a spectacle that’s equal parts <strong data-start=\"1061\" data-end=\"1091\">athletic feat and art form</strong>.</p>\n<p data-start=\"1096\" data-end=\"1177\">But the story of Mallakhamb isn’t just about training. It begins with a legend.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://mallakhambist.in/media/posts/11/123-2.avif\" alt=\"Mallakhamb in front of Red Fort, Delhi, India.\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\">\n<figcaption >Image courtesy - blackbeltmag.com</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p data-start=\"1096\" data-end=\"1177\"> </p>\n<h1 data-start=\"1184\" data-end=\"1225\">The Challenge No One Dared to Accept</h1>\n<p data-start=\"1227\" data-end=\"1506\">The year was the late 1700s. The Nizam of Hyderabad was proud of two men in his court: Ali and Gulab—giants of wrestlers, said to be nearly eight feet tall, their muscles carved like stone. They were undefeated. No one in India—or the world—had ever managed to throw them down.</p>\n<p data-start=\"1508\" data-end=\"1610\">When they arrived at the court of <strong data-start=\"1542\" data-end=\"1563\">Peshwa Bajirao II</strong> in Pune, they issued a thunderous challenge:</p>\n<p data-start=\"1612\" data-end=\"1673\">“Bring us your best wrestler. Let him face us—if he dares.”</p>\n<p data-start=\"1675\" data-end=\"1849\">The royal court fell silent. <strong data-start=\"1704\" data-end=\"1727\">Fifty-two wrestlers</strong> stood frozen, none willing to risk their life and honor. The Peshwa’s pride was at stake, and defeat seemed inevitable.</p>\n<figure ><figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://mallakhambist.in/media/posts/11/balambhattadada.jpg\" alt=\"Balambhatta Dada Deodhar: The Father of Mallakhamb\" width=\"647\" height=\"778\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://mallakhambist.in/media/posts/11/responsive/balambhattadada-xs.jpg 300w ,https://mallakhambist.in/media/posts/11/responsive/balambhattadada-sm.jpg 480w ,https://mallakhambist.in/media/posts/11/responsive/balambhattadada-md.jpg 768w ,https://mallakhambist.in/media/posts/11/responsive/balambhattadada-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://mallakhambist.in/media/posts/11/responsive/balambhattadada-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://mallakhambist.in/media/posts/11/responsive/balambhattadada-2xl.jpg 1600w\"></figure>\n<figcaption >Balambhatta Dada Deodhar: The Father of Mallakhamb</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p data-start=\"1675\" data-end=\"1849\"> </p>\n<p data-start=\"1851\" data-end=\"1990\">That’s when one man stepped forward. Not a hulking wrestler, but a teacher. The court’s physical instructor—<strong data-start=\"1959\" data-end=\"1988\">Balambhatta Dada Deodhar.</strong></p>\n<h1 data-start=\"1997\" data-end=\"2035\">The Dream That Changed Everything</h1>\n<p data-start=\"2037\" data-end=\"2164\">Balambhatta Dada asked for time. He returned to his hometown of <strong data-start=\"2096\" data-end=\"2118\">Kothure, in Nashik</strong>, carrying the burden of his people’s honor.</p>\n<p data-start=\"2166\" data-end=\"2301\">Day after day, he trained. He prayed to his ancestral goddess, <strong data-start=\"2229\" data-end=\"2245\">Saptashrungi</strong>, for strength. And then—one night—everything changed.</p>\n<p data-start=\"2303\" data-end=\"2430\">The goddess appeared in his dream and whispered:<br data-start=\"2351\" data-end=\"2354\">“Worship Lord Hanuman, the god of power. Only then will victory be yours.”</p>\n<p data-start=\"2432\" data-end=\"2648\">That very night, Lord Hanuman himself came to Balambhatta—in the form of a monkey. On a wooden pole, the divine monkey performed dazzling acrobatics, twisting, leaping, and balancing in ways no human could imagine.</p>\n<p data-start=\"2650\" data-end=\"2724\">When Balambhatta Dada awoke, his heart was racing. He knew what he had to do.</p>\n<p data-start=\"2726\" data-end=\"2944\">He built the same wooden pole from his dream. He trained on it day and night, mastering movements inspired by Hanuman’s divine performance. What began as prayer became power. What began as desperation became destiny.</p>\n<h1 data-start=\"2951\" data-end=\"2976\">The Day of Reckoning</h1>\n<p data-start=\"2978\" data-end=\"3124\">The court was overflowing with spectators on the day of the fight. Whispers ran through the crowd: <em data-start=\"3077\" data-end=\"3122\">Could this teacher really fight the giants?</em></p>\n<p data-start=\"3126\" data-end=\"3252\">Ali stepped forward first. He smirked at the smaller man before him. But within moments, his confidence turned to confusion.</p>\n<p data-start=\"3254\" data-end=\"3488\">Balambhatta Dada moved unlike any wrestler Ali had ever seen—his techniques drawn from the pole, swift and fluid, almost otherworldly. Then, in a flash, Balambhatta Dada locked Ali’s neck between his legs, spun, and slammed him to the ground.</p>\n<p data-start=\"3490\" data-end=\"3541\">Ali—the undefeated titan—was defeated in minutes.</p>\n<p data-start=\"3543\" data-end=\"3597\">The crowd erupted. The impossible had just happened.</p>\n<p data-start=\"3599\" data-end=\"3721\">Seeing his partner’s downfall, Gulab panicked. Instead of stepping forward, he fled. The match was over before it began.</p>\n<p data-start=\"3723\" data-end=\"3828\">The Peshwas cheered. The teacher had saved their honor. From that day on, he was honored as <strong data-start=\"3815\" data-end=\"3826\">“Dada.”</strong></p>\n<h1 data-start=\"3835\" data-end=\"3863\">The Birth of Mallakhamb</h1>\n<p data-start=\"3865\" data-end=\"4128\">The wooden pole Balambhatta Dada had built became more than a training tool. It was a bridge between worship and warfare, between art and athletics. Wrestlers—<em data-start=\"4019\" data-end=\"4027\">mallas</em>—began to train on it, and soon, the practice earned its name: <strong data-start=\"4090\" data-end=\"4126\">Mallakhamb, the wrestler’s pole.</strong></p>\n<p data-start=\"4130\" data-end=\"4378\">What started as a weapon of survival grew into a tradition. And today, centuries later, it has evolved into a <strong data-start=\"4240\" data-end=\"4276\">modern sport practiced worldwide</strong>—a breathtaking blend of strength, flexibility, and artistry, standing proudly alongside gymnastics.</p>\n<h1 data-start=\"4385\" data-end=\"4407\">More Than a Sport</h1>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://mallakhambist.in/media/posts/11/mallah.gif\" alt=\"Old Mallakhamb Pyramid picture\" width=\"600\" height=\"936\"></figure>\n<figcaption >Image courtesy - sports.indiapress.org</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p> </p>\n<p data-start=\"4409\" data-end=\"4538\">Mallakhamb is not just exercise. It’s a story of resilience. A reminder that when tradition meets creativity, legends are born.</p>\n<p data-start=\"4540\" data-end=\"4790\">The pole that once saved a kingdom’s honor now inspires athletes across the globe. And as the sport continues to grow, it carries with it the spirit of its origins—<strong data-start=\"4704\" data-end=\"4788\">the courage of Balambhatta Dada, the blessing of Hanuman, and the soul of India.</strong></p>\n<p data-start=\"4797\" data-end=\"4926\"> </p>",
